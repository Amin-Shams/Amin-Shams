### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate undergraduate student who loves coding and exploring new technologies. I'm familiar with JavaScript, CSS, HTML, C++, C, and Python and I'm always eager to learn more.

## Projects

Here are some of the Mini projects I've worked on recently:

- [Project One](https://github.com/AP-projects-4001/esm-nadarim) - A C++ program that simulates a shop application. (But it's unfortunately offline...)
  and this project was a teamwork for AP Project at university
  
- [Mini Project Two](https://amin-shams.github.io/site-html-basic/) - A very simple single webpage
